# Four partially optimized keyboard layouts

## 14lfq

A heavy modification of R. Alan Reiser's [Hands On](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/more-variations#h.6pnxfc5vsy65) keyboard layout.
Reduces the number of changes from QWERTY to 14 letters while keeping many of it strengths. 
14lfq = 14 letters from QWERTY.
Definitely not as low-SFB as Colemak or some other modern layouts but more comfortable over longer sessions (to me at least; YMMV). Made for a standard ANSI slab; no clue how it would work on ergonomic boards. 

## Hands On UI v2 / Theorem

The v2 variant of my earlier attempt at customizing Hands On keeps G, W and M in their QWERTY locations and is a little better in SFB's and distance.
Tongue-in-cheek nicknamed "theorem" because of how nicely that rolls on this mostly alternating layout.

## Athena

Superior to the two above in my opinion, hence why it gets to have a depiction.
Since there is so little in common with the original Hands On I'll just call this "Athena" which can be typed very comfortably on the home row.
Athena may in fact be classified as a mod of Hands Down Reference with somewhat more qwerty likeness. Swap B and K depending on how often you'd type either; I've just chose to keep the qwerty B position but it _is_ quite a reach for the right index finger...
Credits for its best properties are to be given to the original Hands Down variations by Alan Reiser.

## Athena Alt

Alternate implementation using NSRT on left hand and for me personally it is the best of the bunch (not necessarily reflected by stats in keyboard analyzers).
I've since come to swap Q and W but I think that's an arbitrary change so the depiction stays as-is in this repo.

Alt is slightly more right-hand balanced than regular Athena I'd say but not dramatically so. Still very much an alternating layout.
Efficiency should be comparable to regular Athena.
