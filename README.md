# Five partially optimized keyboard layouts

## 13lfq

Inspired by R. Alan Reiser's [Hands On](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/more-variations#h.6pnxfc5vsy65) keyboard layout.
A relatively limited amount of keys change from QWERTY.
13lfq = 13 letters from QWERTY.
Not as low-SFB as Colemak or some other modern layouts but not all _that_ far off and more alternation which I happen to prefer. Made for a standard ANSI slab; no clue how it would work on ergonomic boards. 

## Eureka

The name is not meant to be signify brilliance on the part of the layout or its author. It's merely a greek word that can be typed on the home row, just as with my other Athena layout ;)
A trial in keeping even closer to QWERTY than 13lfq.
Other than a little extra finger-travel it looks to score about as high as 13lfq on klanext (which is to say, better than most other 12-key change-layouts wrt SFB's and alternation).


## Hands On UI v2 / Theorem

The v2 variant of my earlier attempt at customizing Hands On keeps G, W and M in their QWERTY locations and is a little better in SFB's and distance.
Tongue-in-cheek nicknamed "theorem" because of how nicely that rolls on this mostly alternating layout.

## Athena

Superior to the two above in my opinion, hence why it gets to have a depiction.
Since there is so little in common with the original Hands On I'll just call this "Athena" which can be typed very comfortably on the home row.
Athena may in fact be classified as a mod of Hands Down Reference with somewhat more qwerty likeness. Swap B and K depending on how often you'd type either; I've just chose to keep the qwerty B position but it _is_ quite a reach for the right index finger...
Credits for its best properties are to be given to the original Hands Down variations by Alan Reiser.

## Athena Alt

![](https://github.com/ijzerbroot/handsonui/blob/main/athena-alt.png)

Alternate implementation using NSRT on left hand and for me personally it is the best of the bunch (not necessarily reflected by stats in keyboard analyzers).
I've since come to swap Q and W but I think that's an arbitrary change so the depiction stays as-is in this repo.

Alt is slightly more right-hand balanced than regular Athena I'd say but not dramatically so. Still very much an alternating layout.
Efficiency should be comparable to regular Athena.
