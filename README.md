# Hands On UI keyboard layout

A slight modification of R. Alan Reiser's [Hands On](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/more-variations#h.6pnxfc5vsy65) keyboard layout.

Changes done for my personal comfort.
It's a little closer to QWERTY but still scores well on klanext.

The v2 variant keeps G, W and M in their QWERTY locations and is a little better in SFB's and distance.
It is however less of an alternator than the base version. Matter of preference.
