# Two partially optimized keyboard layouts

## Hands On UI

A slight modification of R. Alan Reiser's [Hands On](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/more-variations#h.6pnxfc5vsy65) keyboard layout.

Changes done for my personal comfort.

## Hands On UI v2 / Theorem
The v2 variant keeps G, W and M in their QWERTY locations and is a little better in SFB's and distance.
It is however less of an alternator than the base version. Matter of preference.
Tongue-in-cheek nicknamed "theorem" because of how nicely that rolls on this mostly alternating layout.
Depending on preference and commonly typed words, swapping I and O may work better.
