# Four partially optimized keyboard layouts

## Hands On UI

A slight modification of R. Alan Reiser's [Hands On](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/more-variations#h.6pnxfc5vsy65) keyboard layout.

Changes done for my personal comfort.

## Hands On UI v2 / Theorem
The v2 variant keeps G, W and M in their QWERTY locations and is a little better in SFB's and distance.
It is however less of an alternator than the base version. Matter of preference.
Tongue-in-cheek nicknamed "theorem" because of how nicely that rolls on this mostly alternating layout.

## Athena

My personal favourite (along with its alt-variant; both have their pros and cons).
Since there is so little in common with the original Hands On I'll just call this "Athena" which can be typed very comfortably on the home row.
Athena may in fact be classified as a mod of Hands Down Reference with somewhat more qwerty likeness. Swap B and K depending on how often you'd type either; I've just chose to keep the qwerty B position but it _is_ quite a reach for the right index finger...
Credits for its best properties are to be given to the original Hands Down variations by Alan Reiser.

## Athena Alt

Alternate implementation using NSRT on left hand.
Slightly more right-hand balanced I'd say and beneficial for some words.
Efficiency should be comparable to regular Athena.
