# Seven partially optimized keyboard layouts

## Eureka-unix

![](https://github.com/ijzerbroot/handsonui/blob/main/eureka-unix.png)
A relatively limited amount of keys change from QWERTY. (13 letters move)
13lfq = 13 letters from QWERTY.
Nicer movement for some commonly used unix and SQL commands such as _cd_, _delete_, _do_, _order_, _end_, _DES_, _db_, etc. 

## Eureka

The name is not meant to be signify brilliance on the part of the layout or its author. It's merely a greek word that can be typed on the home row, just as with my other Athena layout ;)
A trial in keeping even closer to QWERTY than 13lfq.
Other than a little extra finger-travel it looks to score about as high as 13lfq on klanext (which is to say, better than most other 12-key change-layouts wrt SFB's and alternation).

# Eureka-plus

14 letters changed from QWERTY.  
As it did so well on klanext it's been added to my repo.

# Nuklear-power

![](https://github.com/ijzerbroot/handsonui/blob/main/nuklear-power.png)
A mere 8 letters changed from QWERTY.  
Absolutely going for rock-bottom here. HKL stay in qwerty's place, J and N swap position.
Keeps vim somewhat close to its natural bindings.
Amazingly enough it still does relatively well on klanext (at least it looks to beat minimak8 on all the tests I ran). 


## Hands On UI v2 / Theorem

![](https://github.com/ijzerbroot/handsonui/blob/main/handson-ui-v2.png)
The v2 variant of my earlier attempt at customizing Hands On keeps G, W and M in their QWERTY locations and is a little better in SFB's and distance.
Tongue-in-cheek nicknamed "theorem" because of how nicely that rolls on this mostly alternating layout.

## Athena

![](https://github.com/ijzerbroot/handsonui/blob/main/athena.png)

Superior to the two above in my opinion, hence why it gets to have a depiction.
Since there is so little in common with the original Hands On I'll just call this "Athena" which can be typed very comfortably on the home row.
Athena may in fact be classified as a mod of Hands Down Reference with somewhat more qwerty likeness. Swap B and K depending on how often you'd type either; I've just chose to keep the qwerty B position but it _is_ quite a reach for the right index finger...
Credits for its best properties are to be given to the original Hands Down variations by Alan Reiser.

## Athena Alt

![](https://github.com/ijzerbroot/handsonui/blob/main/athena-alt.png)

Alternate implementation using NSRT on left hand and for me personally it is the best of the bunch (not necessarily reflected by stats in keyboard analyzers).
I've since come to swap Q and W but I think that's an arbitrary change so the depiction stays as-is in this repo.

Alt is slightly more right-hand balanced than regular Athena I'd say but not dramatically so. Still very much an alternating layout.
Efficiency should be comparable to regular Athena.
