# Three partially optimized keyboard layouts

## Hands On UI

A slight modification of R. Alan Reiser's [Hands On](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/more-variations#h.6pnxfc5vsy65) keyboard layout.

Changes done for my personal comfort.

## Hands On UI v2 / Theorem
The v2 variant keeps G, W and M in their QWERTY locations and is a little better in SFB's and distance.
It is however less of an alternator than the base version. Matter of preference.
Tongue-in-cheek nicknamed "theorem" because of how nicely that rolls on this mostly alternating layout.

## Athena

My personal favourite.
Swapped I and O from Handson UI v2. Since there is so little in common with the original Hands On I'll just call this "Athena" which can be typed very comfortably on the home row.
It may be better to swap D and G and/or A and I for some depending ojn personal preference.
